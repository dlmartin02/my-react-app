<div id="content">
<p><strong>What are Colonics?</strong><br />
Colon Hydrotherapy is referred to as Colonics or Colon Irrigation. A colonic uses water (hydro) therapy for inner cleansing. My equipment is the Open System/LIBBE.</p>

<p><strong>How does this work?</strong><br />
A soothing flow of purified warm water is instilled gently into the colon through a disposable rectal nozzle, which is the size of a pencil.The waste comes out AROUND this small nozzle whenever the client wants to release. The nozzle almost always stays in for the entire session unless the client wants it out for any reason..&nbsp;Water flows through a Carbon Filter which removes any sediment, rust, or chlorine. An Ultra Violet Purification System also purifies the water before it passes through the rectal nozzle. Water flows gently into the rectum and waste releases naturally as the client pushes it out whenever needing to go. It goes down a drain below them and through a view tube and then disappears to the sewer..</p>

<p><strong>Is there pain?</strong><br />
No, but for a few people,&nbsp;there&nbsp;might be&nbsp;a little&nbsp;discomfort as the waste is loosened and prepares to be released, but it soon passes. The client can be in control of the water flow.&nbsp;This means that the client&nbsp;may turn the water flow as low as he/she wants or even turn it off whenever he/she wants to. Small amounts of water are used, so it gently stimulates the colon&#39;s natural peristaltic action to release softened waste.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any special preparation before a colonic?</strong><br />
It&#39;s best to be well hydrated but&nbsp;not to eat 2 hours before the procedure.</p>

<p><strong>Is treatment private?</strong><br />
Yes. During the session, most of your upper clothing can be kept on and there will be a gown provided. You will undress from the waist down and will be properly draped to always ensure comfort and privacy. After being taught how the equipment works, you may choose whether or not the hydro therapist stays in the room with you or not. You have a bell to call the therapist at any time.</p>

<p><strong>Is there an odor?</strong><br />
No. The odor is disposed through the sewer drainpipe.</p>

<p><strong>How many sessions does one need?</strong><br />
The number of sessions depends on the individual and/or physician requirements. &nbsp;Many physicians suggest twelve sessions over a ten-week period.</p>

<p><strong>How long does a session last?</strong><br />
A single session lasts generally 45-50 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Are all materials sanitized?</strong><br />
Absolutely. Each individual will be provided with a packaged, never used rectal nozzle, and all other materials are safely disinfected after each use.</p>

<p><strong>Will colonics destroy my friendly bacteria?</strong><br />
No, colonics will not destroy friendly bacteria. The most neglected organ of our bodies is the colon. It should be just as normal to clean our colon as our mouth! According to Brenda Watson of Renew Life/Advanced Naturals Companies, we have 10 times the bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract as we have cells in our whole body. They weigh about the same as a brick; most of them are in the colon. We need to clean the environment of the colon so that friendly bacteria can thrive and keep our immune system strong. Otherwise, the unfriendly bacteria will eventually overpower the immune system and we&#39;ll get sick in one way or another. Practically ALL disease is related to fermenting toxic waste in the colon, the bloodstream and throughout the body.</p>

<p><strong>Where can I find more Natural Health Information?</strong><br />
Try Dr. Mercola&#39;s website <a href="http://www.mercola.com" target="_blank">www.mercola.com</a>. I highly recommend Dr. Mercola&#39;s information and it&#39;s free for signing up!</p>

<p>&quot;The Secret To Health&quot; movie by Dr Edward Group reveals that if people would just clean their colons and the environment they expose themselves to, there would be little need for pharmaceutical drugs. Sadly, the medical industry and pharmaceutical industry make many billions a year by &quot;managing&quot; illness while suppressing the simple remedies like colonics. Yet according to Dr Joseph Mercola, medical mistakes/mismanagement are actually the #1 cause of death in this country, ahead of even heart disease and cancer. Go to <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" target="_blank">www.mercola.com</a>; find article from 2/11/12: &quot;Kills More People Than Heart Desease or Cancer (But Hardly Anyone Knows)&quot;. If they were really interested in cures,<strong> they need look no farther than cleansing, taking and eating probiotics, more raw and/or grass-fed organic food, proper and safe sunshine exposure, rest in complete darkness, proper short burst/slow strength training exercise, clean water, less pervasive electromagnetic pollution,etc.</strong> They have found no cures since the polio vaccine (even though they have 55,000 scientists working for cures), because when people are well they make no money. One thing they are good at is trauma care and we can be thankful for that. However, we need to stay away as much as possible from &quot;conventional care&quot; until they integrate and understand how the gut is the GPS of the body. If the GPS (or second brain) is unhappy, where are we going to live?</p>
