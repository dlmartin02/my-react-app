<div id="content">
<p>This is the truth about what I experienced during colon hydrotherapy, and I would like to share it with people. What I thought before my colonics was false, perhaps due to my own inexperienced thought process or because of inaccurate/misleading information from society and the media.<br />
Sally educated and explained everything to me in detail, including information about a healthy lifestyle. The room is private and has a relaxing &quot;feel&quot; to it.I was covered at all times! I was instructed how to use the equipment myself. However, Sally was always available (at the touch of a call button) to answer questions or guide me. I was never exposed.<br />
During the colonic I was relaxed and comfortable. In fact, I almost fell asleep with the relaxation music, warm room, and dim light. I felt significant relief from abdominal bloating and discomfort after the colonic!<br />
<strong>- Lisa Walker</strong></p>

<p>I have experienced a great deal of discomfort with Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Constipation in the past 8 years. However, since receiving colonics, I am feeling better and healthier and I have found relief with Sally&#39;s service.<br />
I am also noticing that my body WANTS to eliminate and that is an answer to my prayers!<br />
<strong>- Susan Sanders</strong></p>

<p>My beginning colonics were no picnic. I was reluctant and did not care for the procedure. Then, Sally Garber telling me that it&#39;s good to have colonics at least a couple days in a row did not make any sense...at first.<br />
Hearing others&#39; testimonies was why I continued, and that is why I&#39;m writing this--to encourage others. Having colonic is simply one of the most sensible things I&#39;ve ever done. By freeing up my colon from being buried in masses of sewage, undigested food, parasites, etc., the vitamins I&#39;ve taken in the past are no longer being wasted, but now can be properly assimilated and do their work.<br />
I am convinced that colonics are totally essential for good health, and having them close together is the best way. Sally was right!<br />
Many thanks to Sally Garber.<br />
<strong>- Frances Lynch</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m so glad I decided to try colonics. Immediately after colonics sessions, my gut feels &quot;soothed&quot;, which is the best way I can describe the feeling. Over time, I noticed I digest food better, have less gas and bloating, feel more energetic, and my skin is becoming clearer.<br />
I thank Sally for her professionalism during colonics sessions, and the knowledge she&#39;s given me on improving my digestive system and ridding my body of toxins. Wish I knew about colonics earlier in my life, but now that I know, it will be a regular part of the rest of my life!<br />
<strong>- A. Cooper</strong></p>

<p>Sally&#39;s Colon Cleansing is an invaluable service that recently was a lifesaver for me. I was very sick with an upper respiratory infection, including bronchitis. Ridding my body of the load of mucus put me back on the path to health! And Sally is a gem: compassionate, attentive and generous. She has a powerful healing way about her that is a great comfort. I always know I will feel much better after visiting Sally!<br />
<strong>Hurrah for Colon Hydrotherapy!</strong></p>

<p>I had been struggling with low energy, brain fog, weight gain, constipation, and depression for months. I tried countless supplements and diets in hopes to feel better with very little improvement. After two sessions at Sally&#39;s I feel like a new person, with newfound energy and passion for life. Very grateful.<br />
<strong>- Samantha</strong></p>

<p>&quot;To me, getting a colonic is better than winning the lottery!&quot;<br />
<strong>- Lori </strong></p>

<p>I had my monthly massage the day after my last appointment with you. My muscles have increasingly been getting worse over the last year. In fact I asked her at the end of the massage if she was just taking it easy on me or if she noticed a difference in my muscles. My therapist told me that my muscle texture was A LOT better than it had been. I am convinced of the benefits of colon hydrotherapy!<br />
Thanks so much for the work that you do!<br />
<strong>- Female client</strong></p>

<p>Sally&#39;s colon cleanse was remarkable! My first experience was gentle and comfortable and I felt lighter and brighter after the experience. It was definitely a first step on the road to revitalization and renewal. Thanks, Sally ! I look forward to regular cleansing in the future.<br />

I LOVE doing colon cleansing at Sally&#39;s! She is a top notch professional--very knowledgeable! The process is easy, painless, affordable, and effective. It has helped me get over a bad URI (upper respiratory infection), plus I feel so good afterward. How can I not feel wonderful after ridding my body of toxic, disease-causing material? This is a therapy for long term good health in body and spirit.<br />
<strong>&ndash;Deb</strong></p>

<p>Sally&rsquo;s colonics bring a great feeling of cleanliness throughout the body. Apparently, it has also helped my skin issues and my overall wellbeing. Thanks for the attention and care that is given by Sally!</p>

<p class="testimonial_name"><strong>-Larry</strong></p>

<p>I have been using colon hydrotherapy for about six weeks and it is just amazing how much better I feel overall. I sleep better, have a great deal of energy when I wake, and have regular bowel movements without medicine. I would recommend this type of treatment to anyone looking for better health in general.</p>

<p class="testimonial_name"><strong>-Jason Lewis</strong></p>

<p>I found Sally Garber&rsquo;s cleansing center after searching on the internet for information on colon hydrotherapy. I had been having sluggish bowel problems for some time and I wanted to see what colon hydrotherapy would do for me. The first couple of treatments left me feeling light and clean, and I noticed things looked brighter and clearer. It was like I had stepped into another dimension of existence. I concluded that the toxins that had built up in my body due to slow elimination had caused me to live at a sub par level of existence. The treatments that I have received from Sally have literally saved my life. I have colon cancer in my family and I am convinced that being proactive about health is one of the best ways of staying healthy. Thank you so much Sally! I am deeply grateful for your health ministry.</p>

<p class="testimonial_name"><strong>-Erien</strong></p>

<p>Sally has changed my life. I feel and look 100% better and my attitude has improved by leaps and bounds. She is very knowledgeable about her field. She is very genuine and she is blessed.</p>

<p class="testimonial_name"><strong>-Vicki Spence</strong></p>

<p>Sally&rsquo;s colonic therapy has improved my everyday life! I actually have energy! My skin started glowing and I feel just all around better, mentally and physically. (Diagnosed with systemic candida.) I cannot thank Sally enough for helping me so much and for being such a compassionate person.</p>

<p class="testimonial_name"><strong>-Jamie, age 24</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m 27 years old and a professional marathoner. Doctors and others say I&rsquo;m a healthy person, but I must say I have not experienced true health until I tried colonic hydrotherapy. More than massage, a good run, or even a &ldquo;good&rdquo; American diet, working with Sally and learning about how my body works has helped me feel stress-free, energetic, cleansed and light. My next hope is to inspire others-like my closest family-to explore true health.</p>

<p class="testimonial_name"><strong>-Emory Mort</strong></p>

<p>I feel a lot better than I have in a long time. I am 57 and haven&rsquo;t felt this good in years.</p>

<p class="testimonial_name"><strong>-Liz L.</strong></p>

<p>Sally&rsquo;s services helped me to &ldquo;go more.&rdquo; My all around health is better. My skin is clearer and brighter. My attitude has improved and I have more energy. I love the professional and private atmosphere. Thanks Sally!</p>
